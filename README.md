Hello and welcome to my first ever mod! Endless Ocean Fantabulastic Edition! Since this is my first mod, I am not very good at things yet, so it will be kinda sloppy on getting it to work, sorry about that!

To avoid Nintendo crackdown, I am not supplying the .ISO file here, also, it can't work in that format anyway. If you don't already have it, you can access the ROM from Vimm's Lair. If it is still in Nkit format, you will need to use Nkit to change it to an .ISO, once you have done that, you can follow the next steps to create a format of the game you can edit. 

HOW TO CHANGE FORMAT:

<p>-First you need to go to your config menu in Dolphin emulator, and go to Paths- make sure you have "Search subfolders" selected.<br>
-Then back in the main menu, go to your copy of Endless Ocean, right click it and hit "Properties" <br>
-In the properties menu, naviate to "Filesystem" and right click "Disk" and hit "Extract entire disk"<br>
-Extract this disk to a folder of your choice, just be sure this folder is also selected in the previously mentioned "Paths" folder so that Dolphin can find it<br>

-You should now have an extracted version of the game! Very simple :) </p>

PREP FOR INSTALING THE MOD:

<b>!!YOU NEED 7-ZIP FOR THIS TO WORK!!</b>

<p>Because of the size of the game, the only way I was able to upload it was in parts :*) here's how to turn "Wow what a mess!" back into GAME.DAT:<br>
-Unzip "Wow what a mess" With whatever program you like<br>
-Select ALL the folders found in "Wow what a mess!" and right click it<br>
-Let it extract wherever you want, it should ultimately wind up back in folder format called "New Compressed (zipped) Folder_2"<br>
-Inside of that folder is another Zip (I'm so sorry I warned you dude)<br>
-Extract this Zip like normal using whatever program you want, inside the new extracted folder should be GAME.DAT</p>


HOW TO INSTALL MOD (1)

<p>-Navigate to your extracted version of the game, Enter the "Data" Folder, and then the "Files" folder, there should be 3 files in this folder as well as a folder named "BGM"<br>
-Delete GAME.DAT and replace it with the GAME.DAT you got from the download here<br>
-Enter the folder called "bgm"<br>
-Duplicate any of the files "bgm_spot" or "hayley" EXCEPT for "bgm_spot4"<br>
-Delete "bgm_spot4" and rename your duplicated files "bgm_spot4"<br>
-You have now successfully installed one part of the mod!</p>

HOW TO INSTALL MOD (2)

<p>-Navigate to the following location in your pc:<br>
    <div>C:\Users\(Your PC name)\Documents\Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures\RFBE01 <br>
    (If this exact folder does not exist yet, you can simply put the folder found in this download "RFBE01" in the "Load" folder and you are done with installing the entire mod!)</div><br>
-Drag the folder "RFBE1" from this download into the "Load" folder, it will ask you if you want to merge this file, go ahead and merge them, and you have successfully installed the entire mod! </p>


I plan to continue servicing this mod as I think of other stuff to add, you can refer to the changelog for what this mod does, but I encourage you to go looking for yourself and find the little surprises as you go along, I think it would be more fun that way! Anyway, thanks for enjoying my mod!
